1. Project Abstract
The project is a puzzle game inspired by a 2D maze generator project in github. I want to transfer this idea into a 3D maze generator and some more challenge to become a game. The players will insert details of the maze and solve the maze they create. 
2. Project Relevance
This project will help my group learn how to work in an Agile environment and utilize some maze algorithms like Kruskal, etc. This project also utilize multithread to create a large maze in a shorter amount of time (for difficult level).  
3. Conceptual Design
In this project, I will try to take part of the overview of the project. I will do mostly in game design, interface and the algorithm parts.
4. Background
https://github.com/artcfox/maze-generator
5. Required Resources
Members who know about C, C++, or game design are preferred.
Software/ Hardware : I’m considering among Unity or Unreal Engine ( for the 3D one) or Android Studio or build from scratch with C but only for 2D version.
