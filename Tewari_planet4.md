Planet4: Website Builder and Digital Engagement Platform- OS Contribution

Project Abstract: 
Planet4 is an open source software project by Greenpeace. Planet4 is a global engagement platform which enables Greenpeace supporters and activists to interact and
engage with the organization. The goal of this project is to motivate people to take action against climate change. It drives people to unite and fight for the environment 
by collaborating on issues like reducing plastic pollution. This project is available in "planet4" repository on github. Developers can fork the repository and contribute as they 
see fit. Planet4 implements WordPress Coding Standards, and uses the linters PHP_CodeSniffer, ESLint, and Stylelint. 

Project Relevance: 
This project is linked to the educational goals of this class in multiple different ways. It will provide students experience with working in small teams together to modify and 
contribute to an open source program on Github. This project will give practice in testing, as it uses acceptance testing and visual regression testing. It is set to do this 
automatically, but contributors can also manually create and run their own tests. Students can also be exposed to the concept of version control as they can manage and keep track 
modifications to the code using github commit history. Students will be required to build and run the project on their computers in order to contribute. Finally, students will be
able to learn about issue tracking. The repository has an issue tracking tab where issues can be created and published for others to solve, or students can choose an already existing \
issue to solve and contribute to the project. 

Conceptual Design:
I will contribute to this project by resolving one of the posted issues in Github. I will replace the "Greenpeace" logo at the top of the sidebar nav to say "Planet 4 Handbook" 
and insert a smaller Greenpeace logo below. I will hyperlink the added logo to go to the handbook home, https://planet4.greenpeace.org/handbook/. Lastly, I will
add a link in the sidebar nav and/or logo to the planet4 landing page, https://planet4.greenpeace.org/.
